title: Web exploitation at SMP, IITR
tags: ['vulnerability-writeups']

## Introduction 

SMP website is made for proper management of student mentorship program in IIT Roorkee. Being InfoSec enthusiasts, we tried to scan for any form of vulnerabilities lying on the website waiting to be exploited. We found several vulnerabilities and were able to successfully exploit them too. After doing a responsible disclosure of the bugs to the maintainers of the website, we have prepared this writeup which basically demonstrates the whole scenario from bug finding straight to it's exploitation.

## Subdomain Enumeration 

We used the tool **assetfinder** to find out the domains of **iitr.ac.in** belonging to SMP. There, one could see the name of `api-smp.iitr.ac.in`.

Wondering, how the API is functioning, we opened it on the browser. As visible in the snapshot, the api was using **CoreAPI** with **Django REST framework**. The major vulnerability was that `DEBUG` is set to `True` in the production environment, which enabled any attacker to pentest the behaviour of all endpoints present on the API and see verbose errors in return.

## Vulnerable Endpoints

Seeing the listed endpoints, we move on to `/docs` endpoint. This is a standard endpoint which contains a proper documentation of all the endpoints, as well as all the methods accepted by them and their expected parameters(if any).

Anyone with basic development knowledge, must be knowing that POST requests to sensitive endpoints must be proper validated. But, this was not the case here. The endpoints `apply > create` and `interests >  create` were accepting `POST` requests. **To our surprise, there was no proper validation on the source of these POST requests**. Therefore, we thought of making a Proof of Concept for the vulnerability.

# Exploitation Part 

## Creating an arbitrary mentor with InfoSecIITR as display profile 

After learning about `apply > create` endpoint, we made a `POST` request to the `/mentors/apply` path with the parameters it expected. And after getting a successful response from the server, we listed the mentors via API, and then saw the main website of SMP.

`THE API` : listing mentors containing `Exploit.IMG` name was done by us.

## Creating arbitrary interests in the Interests section 

After learning about `interests > create` endpoint which basically created Areas of Interests so that students can filter the mentors, we wrote a python script to upload arbitrary interests in that section. 

`The script` used in exploitation:

After running the script, and getting a successful response from the server, we left `HACKED` and `InfoSecIITR` in the Areas of Interest as a mark that we were involved in the pentesting of the website. 

Listing Interests in the API containing `InfoSecIITR` :

All hail **InfoSecIITR**!!
